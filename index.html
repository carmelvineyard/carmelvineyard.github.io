	<p>Carmel is not <i>quite</i> as old as Star Wars, but she's close enough. She's also annoyed that the month of September has been forgotten over Halloween and Pumpkin Spice Everything. Fall doesn't <i>actually</i> begin until September 22nd or 23rd, people.</p>
	<p>Carmel has three kids, who she homeschools. Because starting a career, unpacking a house, and selling a bunch of stuff wasn't enough. Her kids really are why she gets up in the morning. She's enjoying her entry into the larger world of coding.</p>
